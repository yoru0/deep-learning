# Deep Learning

Collection of Jupyter notebooks that walk through fundamental deep learning workflows using TensorFlow and the Python data-science stack.

## Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.10 or newer.
2. (Optional) create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notes
- Some training loops run for many epochs; adjust the `epochs` argument if you are prototyping.
